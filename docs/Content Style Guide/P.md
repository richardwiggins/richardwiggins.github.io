## Paragraphs
Paragraphs should be kept short on web pages.

Research shows that most people will scan a web page. Heavy blocks of text are not easy to read on screen and vital points can be missed.

Use a bulleted list to emphasise the main points wherever possible.

## Parents and carers
Use 'parents and carers' instead of 'parents and guardians'.

Spell out 'and' rather than using 'parents/carers'.

## Plain English
Aim to be as clear and concise as possible.

Using plain English does not mean you are dumbing down your text, rather you are delivering your message in the clearest way possible.

Don?t forget that often you are writing for a mixed audience whose first language may not be English.
