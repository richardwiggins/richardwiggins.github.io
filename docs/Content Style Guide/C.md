## Capital letters
Headings and page titles should be in sentence case (have their first word capitalised only):

Subject areas and job titles are all lower case.

Exceptions: Proper nouns, official titles (books, and so on) and course titles written in full.

Jim Harker is the leader of the county council

Final policy decisions are made by the Leader of the County Council, Jim Harker

## Council
Use capital C in council only when referring to a council by its full name (ie Northamptonshire County Council).

Use lower case for council when using in a sentence without a town or city preceding it (ie 'call your local council').

When referring to the the council, or Northamptonshire County Council, use the singular form of verbs, eg

'the county council offers free parking' (not 'the county council offer')

However, use 'we' when talking on the council's behalf, eg

'we offer free parking'
